    <h1>The Vocaloid Application And How It Works</h1>
    <p>Different vocaloid products and applications can be downloaded online. Most of the applications cost money, but there is one vocaloid that I know of (Teto) that's free. You can find songs created with Teto on YouTube. One of her most famous songs is "Kasane Territory" or "Teto Territory". However, her voice quality isn't as high as most vocaloids, and her system dosen't offer many features, which is why Teto is free.</p>
