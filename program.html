    <p>Different vocaloid products and applications can be downloaded online. Most of the applications cost money, but there is one vocaloid that I know of (Teto) that's free. You can find songs created with Teto on YouTube. One of her most famous songs is "Kasane Territory" or "Teto Territory". However, her voice quality isn't as high as most vocaloids, and her system dosen't offer many features, which is why Teto is free. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA5PGVMHhQI">Here is a link to "Kasane Territory".</a></p>
    <p>The Vocaloid software and how it works is summed up well <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-does-Vocaloid-work">in this answer</a>. Here is a quote from the answer because I need to get this paragraph to 5 sentences and because I need to pander to anyone out there who is too lazy to click a link. "Vocaloids are essentially a class of programs which takes your voice samples and  synthesize them through an engine. All of the product lines of Vocaloids out there like Hatsune Miku and IA are essentially generated models of voice samples which are fed into the synthesizer, therefore allowing your computer to generate singing voices." There. Please give me a good grade, I'm out of ideas for this website.</p>
