    <h1>Vocaloids</h1>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Vocaloids are computer-produced voices used for singing. They are rapidly gaining fame all over the world due to the terrific songs that feature them. You may have heard of Hatsune Miku before- she is a vocaloid, along with many others. She mayy be the most famous one, however. Vocaloids were developed by the Yamaha Corporation. There are multiple vocaloids, each with a different voice. I have a list of official vocaloids on my other page, there is a link to it at the bottom of this page. Some of these vocaloids include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hatsune Miku</li>
      <li>Len and Rin Kagamine</li>
      <li>Megurine Luka</li>
      <li>Kaito</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <p>Vocaloids are usually shown as anime-style characters. Here is one such picture. This is Kaito.</p>

      <p>Vocaloids are sold as applications. Anybody with enough money can download and use them. Here are a few examples of user-created Vocaloid songs:</p>
